# Bill-Split-App
React App to split a bill, while also clearing past debts and accounting for dishes shared in various ways amongst people in a group.
It is often that one goes out with a group of friends. Few order meat, few order drinks - but don't we all split bills equally almost always. 
Firstly, is because it is simply difficult to suggest a fair splitting of amounts, and, secondly, the math just seems too much. 
This web-app is a solution to both these problems. Just as the existence of SplitWise made it easier to suggest adding expenses to a record,
the existence of this web-app is aimed at making it easier to suggest fair splitting of the bill amount. Secondly, it does all the complicated 
math for you - and you can also settle all your previous records with people, all in one go. 

Harry and Suzy had drinks, but Midge owes Harry, so she can cover the drinks, but Suzy only had one drink, while Harry had almost all of them - don't worry,
this solution ensures that you only pay what you owe.

Here's a complete walkthrough of the web-app: 

1. Add the names of all the people on the table (regardless of how much they ate – even if they did not eat at all, but have a debt record to be cleared, their name can be added)

2. Add all the dishes ordered, no. of units ordered and the price per dish (In the future, I will use OCR to make this a scan and go thing)

3. Add any debt records. You can select the name of the ower and the owed (the ower cannot be the owed :) )

4. Assign dishes to people. Notice here how only one person had the Martini / omelette, only 2 people had the cake, but everyone had
everything else.

5. Get your amounts and chip in!

It's that simple.
