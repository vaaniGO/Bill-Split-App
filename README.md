# Bill-Split-App
React App to split a bill, while also clearing past debts and accounting for dishes shared in various ways amongst people in a group.
It is often that one goes out with a group of friends. Few order meat, few order drinks - but don't we all split bills equally almost always. 
Firstly, is because it is simply difficult to suggest a fair splitting of amounts, and, secondly, the math just seems too much. 
This web-app is a solution to both these problems. Just as the existence of SplitWise made it easier to suggest adding expenses to a record,
the existence of this web-app is aimed at making it easier to suggest fair splitting of the bill amount. Secondly, it does all the complicated 
math for you - and you can also settle all your previous records with people, all in one go.

this solution ensures that you only pay what you owe. 

It is deployed here:
